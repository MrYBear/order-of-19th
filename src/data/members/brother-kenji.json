  "fullBio": "Kenji's life was shaped by corporate Japan: long hours, strict hierarchies, and a professional obsession with rules and compliance. Golf became his escape precisely because it mirrored that structure—etiquette, sequence, unspoken codes—while leaving more room for human warmth and story. He was invited into the Order years before Betty or Dean, through senior Japanese members who had carried the tradition back from the UK and Europe, and for decades he regarded its secrecy as a virtue, not a problem.\n\nEarly retirement gave him time to travel, playing courses around the world and tending to quiet networks of members from Tokyo to London. He met Betty on a winter trip to Florida and later re‑encountered Devereux in London, where he learned of growing pressure to take the Order partially online. Kenji opposed the idea on principle, but eventually accepted a difficult role: if the Order was going to do this at all, he would be involved, acting as conscience and brake. In the modern era, as Betty pushes for openness and Dean measures impact, Kenji stands at the edge of the fairway, reminding them what must never be turned into content and what debt is still owed to those who kept the 19th in shadow for a century."
