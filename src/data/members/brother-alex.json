  "fullBio": "Alexander Chen grew up in San Francisco's tech boom, the son of Taiwanese immigrants who ran a small hardware store in the Sunset District. While his peers dreamed of startups and IPOs, Alex was drawn to history—specifically, the overlooked stories of early Chinese-American communities in California.\n\nHe stumbled into golf through a college girlfriend who worked at a municipal course. What started as a summer job became an obsession—not with the game itself, but with the culture surrounding it. Alex noticed how golf clubs were repositories of oral history, places where stories were passed down generation to generation. It reminded him of the Chinese tradition of ancestral storytelling.\n\nAfter studying anthropology at Berkeley, Alex founded a tech company that used AI to preserve endangered languages and oral traditions. The company was acquired in 2015, leaving him financially comfortable but searching for deeper purpose. He started playing more seriously at Pebble Beach, where he met an older member who quietly mentioned 'the 19th' after a particularly meaningful round.\n\nThat introduction led Alex to the Order. He joined in 2018, drawn to the idea of preserving golf's storytelling traditions in the digital age without losing their essence. He's become the Order's voice on how technology can serve tradition rather than replace it—a delicate balance he navigates daily."
