  "fullBio": "Betty grew up loving membership culture—PTA committees, neighborhood groups, book clubs—and when she moved to Florida later in life, golf clubs became her natural habitat, a place where stories, rituals, and friendships overlapped. In 2001, while helping a small local historical society catalogue old documents, she stumbled across strange references to a mysterious 'Order of the 19th,' a discovery that led to quiet correspondence, cautious vetting, and eventually her initiation into the brotherhood.\n\nAs the Order aged and golf culture around her shifted, Betty became the voice insisting that silence would mean slow death, not noble secrecy. She argued that community, storytelling, and carefully chosen new members were the only way the Order's stories would survive another generation. When she later met Kenji on a winter trip and recognised the same symbol on his bag, and then crossed paths with Dean in Scotland, she helped weave the three into a loose alliance that would one day honour Brother Devereux's final request: to bring the Order, gently, into the digital age."
