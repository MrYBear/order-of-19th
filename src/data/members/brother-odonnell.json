  "fullBio": "Brother O'Donnell was born in New York to an Irish immigrant family that had learned early that the surest way to rise in America was to own a room where other men wanted to sit. His father had run a small hotel near the docks; his mother kept a boarding house where ship captains and railway men paid for warmth and a bed without questions. From them, O'Donnell inherited a simple understanding: a good room was worth more than a good score, and knowing whom to introduce to whom was the quickest path to influence.\n\nIn his twenties, O'Donnell found himself drawn to the growing world of American golf. The game had arrived late to the country, but it was arriving loud. Wealthy men were building grand clubs on Long Island, and championship courses were being marked out faster than tradition could settle. He played indifferently but watched everything: how men changed on the course, how they drank afterwards, how a carefully timed introduction could shift a man's fortunes between the nineteenth green and the railway platform home.\n\nBy his thirties, O'Donnell had taken over a modest bar near Shinnecock Hills, one of America's first great courses. The bar was nothing fancy – dark wood, whiskey bottles, and a back room where the light was low and the talk was quieter than the roar of the main room. But it was exactly positioned to catch the tide of men coming down off the links: touring professionals preparing for the growing circuit of majors, local millionaires who played for stakes, caddies who knew everyone's game, and Wall Street men who had discovered that a round of golf and a proper evening afterward could move more business than a morning in an office.\n\nO'Donnell did not invent the 19th hole in America – it was already habit – but he elevated it into something closer to art. He learned the travelling golfers' names and their quirks. He knew which pro needed quiet and which needed rousing company after a loss. He introduced caddie masters to club owners, young players to aging champions, and nervous newcomers to the sort of evening that made them feel they belonged. He kept a ledger, not of accounts, but of introductions: who had met whom, and with what result. Over drinks, fortunes were quietly redistributed, partnerships formed, and young players lifted into better circles.\n\nAs American golf boomed – as it became a spectacle on newsreels, a pursuit of the newly wealthy, a path for ambitious young men – O'Donnell's bar became one of the few places where the old custom of the 19th hole, the quiet gathering, the story told slowly over a glass, still held its value. Touring pros knew his room. Club presidents knew to find him there after a course dedication. Even some of the early television commentators, aware that the game was changing faster than anyone quite understood, would sit at his corner table and shake their heads about how the majors were becoming circuses while the true business of golf – understanding a man's character – happened in rooms like his.\n\nBy the time O'Donnell retired, American golf had transformed from a gentleman's pastime into a billion-dollar spectacle. But within the Order, he is remembered as the man who carried the customs of the 19th hole – Scottish, English, Indian – across the Atlantic and made them stick in the new world's loudest, most ambitious game. He proved that Liang's simple principle – service first, then stories, then influence – worked just as well in a Long Island bar in the age of radio and television as it had at a cart on St Andrews links. The 19th hole, he used to say, was not a place. It was a way of finishing a round with your full self intact."
