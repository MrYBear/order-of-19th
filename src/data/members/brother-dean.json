  "fullBio": "Dean grew up in the shadow of famous Scottish links, watching visitors fly in to play fairways his neighbours could barely afford to walk. From teenage odd jobs to full‑time work on the course, he learned every contour of the land and, in quiet corners of sheds and clubhouses, absorbed an older, unwritten history of the game. Among whispered stories and half‑hidden symbols, he began to notice a recurring thread that led back to the Order of the 19th.\n\nThrough patience and discretion he earned the trust of older members, and with their sponsorship he joined the Order, bringing with him a brutally honest sense of what was dying: ageing memberships, shrinking waiting lists, and empty locker rooms where stories used to live. Introduced to the wider network by Brother Devereux, and later drawn into deeper conversation with Betty and Kenji, Dean became the grounded middle of the trio—the one who could say, without romance, 'If we don't change, this dies,' and still respect the sanctity of what must never be put online."
