*Stories submitted by: The Order Archive - Brother Calder*

> **Editor's Note:** The following account has been preserved from the Order's archives. Some minor adjustments to wording have been made for modern readability, but the spirit and substance of the original telling remain unchanged.

You want to know who first spoke of the nineteenth? Sit close. It wasn't a joke, and it wasn't a dream. It was mine. And for a time, I thought I could make it real.

St Andrews, 1764. The day they cut the Old Course from twenty-two holes to eighteen, the world cheered. A tidy frame for a growing game. The committees called it progress. I called it a mistake. Because the best part of golf was never on the map.

I had watched for years how the game truly ended. Not with the last putt, but with the walk back. The quiet apology. The shared drink. The laughter that softened grudges. That was the hole no architect could draw. So I decided to draw it myself.

I sketched plans by candlelight. A room beyond the course, hidden from the scorecard. A place where rivals could shake hands and stories could breathe. I called it the Invisible Hole. And then, in a fit of pride, I built it. A snug chamber behind the inn, marked with a sign that read simply: "The Nineteenth."

At first, it worked. Men came curious, then came loyal. They paid for privacy, for warmth, for the feeling that they belonged to something secret. Coin flowed like ale. I thought I had carved my name into the bones of the game.

But secrets sour. Whispers spread. Some said I was charging too much. Others claimed I was turning a gentleman's ritual into a merchant's trick. One night, a fight broke out. Chairs splintered, bottles shattered, and before dawn the sign was gone. My Invisible Hole vanished like smoke.

Still, I'll tell you this. Every time you raise a glass after a round, you're standing on my idea. They call it tradition now. Back then, it was just a dream and a door behind an inn.

So drink to me, lads. To the hole you cannot play, and the fool who tried to build it.
